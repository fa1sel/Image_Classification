# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. It demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied to solve a common image classification problem using a supervised learning approach.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify an input image as either a cat or a dog.
- **Dataset:** Labeled images of cats and dogs (e.g., [Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)).
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Frameworks Used:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🗂️ Dataset Preparation

- Images are resized to a fixed size .
- Normalization is applied to scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom) is used to enhance model generalization.
- The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Multiple **convolutional** and **max-pooling** layers
- **Dropout** layers to reduce overfitting
- **Binary Cross-Entropy** loss function
- **Adam** optimizer

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## 🚀 Getting Started
